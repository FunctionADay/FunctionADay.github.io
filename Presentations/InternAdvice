# Internship Advice

Your first internship can be nerve racking. Here I'm putting together some of the advice that I've given others throughout the process.

## Picking an intership/CoOp

Make sure you know what you're looking for when you head to career fair, but if you have an offer from one company for a CoOp and another for an internship, I'd take the CoOp more often than not. You can delay any scholarships, and if you're smart about your money you will make up the money that you lose by not having scholarships your last semester. A Co-Op will give you more experience, and a longer duration to prove your value to a company.

## Making the right first impression

Here are a few reasons to make the right first impression.

- Know what kind of dress code the company has
  - Don't show up in a tie to work at a plant, don't show up in a polo to work in an office
- Be prepared when asking questions (take a pad of paper everywhere)
  - A busy PM will not want to asnwer your questions TWICE
- Actively try to get involved in projects
  - Often times you won't just be handed work
- Be cognizant of how your actions look
  - Don't have YouTube up on your computer and then tell your manager you're busy. 
    - Even if you're just listening to music! Keep it in the background!
- Understand the corporate culture
  - This is especially true in more /relaxed/ environments. Being in a "fun" office is great, but even if you have young peers or even a young manager, doens't mean that your manager's manager can't hear you talking to your coworkers.
  - Don't try to be the cool intern. Be the good intern. Don't start busting out jokes before you know how your coworkers will react.

## Working hard

It's a constant struggle to work at 40hr a week job, for many that's more than the time they were studying for school and attending class. Be sure that you're prioritizing being an employee over other stuff. The goal of going to university is to get a job, not to make money so you can drink every night.

Don't show up to work tired. It will make you miserable and your work poor. Get plenty of rest. If it's an option, get in super early in the mornings (this means you'll have to go to bed early too!). You can often get work done better when you have fewer distractions (friends asleep).
