# Changing Your Perspective on Your Engineering Resume

There are tons of sites that have resume tips and tricks, and you can (and should) get advice from the ECC as they are your best bet for being able to talk through your resume. However, as I've mentioned before, while the lofty goal of the ECC is to create good resumes, in reality it's much more pragmatic to create way more not-bad resumes.

Here we'll go over:

- Content
  - What experience to include
  - How to describe your experience
- Presentation
  - What your resume should look like
  - How will you talk about the topics on it
- The Employer Perspective
  - What do they see when they look at your resume
  
We're going to make this an exercise in taking an analytical look at yourself and your resume!

## Content

This is where you are communicating your (professional) life's story to a recruiter. You want to demonstrate to them what skills you've had, and if possible you want to show them that you've already created value in the positions you've held before.

### Experience to include - Struggles of Youth

You are engineering students before anything else in this job search. That means that engineering (more broadly "analytic") content MUST be the focus of your resume. Before you land your first analytical role it's hard to figure out what you should be including. Generally, the answer is to fill it up with project work, but only to the extent that it doesn't interfere with "real" experience

TA-ing, especially for this class, is "real" experience you can put on your resume.

### Experience to include - As a Resume Grows

As your resume gets longer and longer you will need to start pruning out experiences that you've had. Remember that you're writing a resume that is going to be consumed in about 30 seconds (if you're lucky) you're not writing a CV. But then the quesiton is, "what do I cut".

Unfortunately the answer is really to the question of what NOT to cut.

- Don't cut unique experience that you can't show elsewhere on your resume.
  - If you have experience that shows that you can work with people, and the rest of your work is, for example, basically just CAD work, consider leaving in that work.
- Dont' cut "real" experience that fills a time-gap in your resume (cut working at a froyo shop, don't cut working at a math camp)

Finally, most of you won't have enough experience by the time your graduate that you have to elimintate "real" experiences alltogether. Much of it will be pruning bullet points and sentences off of lesser experiences.

### How to Describe Your Experience

New and "experienced" resume writers alike forget that a recruiter is going to spend 10-30 seconds scanning your resume. They're looking for key indicators that you're a good candidate. If you have the time you should be tailoring your resume to include keywords that the automatic systems online will check. If you're going to career fair, consider tailoring your experience to just a few questions.

However all of this is for naught if your description isn't clear and concise. If a recruiter is working through hundreds of resumes (or tens of interviews) in a day you don't really have the time to *read* a resume, they're more just trying to use it to start a conversation. What you have to do is make that conversation the one you want it to be.

## Presentation

### What Your Resume Should Look Like

First, a few basics:

- Use that expensive resume paper
- One Page
- Don't use the printers in the library (or if you do use the ones in the back corner)
- PROOFREAD

Items, roughly in order of appearance.

- Name
- Email, Phone, Location - make sure that the email is NOT in blue and that it is NOT underlined
- Education - School, Degree, Graduation Date, GPA
- Experience - Sorted by most realevant, not by most recent.
  - Each entry should include: Employeer/organization, dates you were there, title, and *brief* description
- Skills - If you have sections, (ex, I have sections for programmin, software, design, and interests) just make sure the formatting is appropriate.
- Honors - Scholarships, Undergraduat research day, awards from events go here
- Memberships - The orgs you were in and your level of involvement ("member" vs "Vice President")

*Personally* I'm a fan of putting Experience before Education, because in my mind my experience shows more about me than my GPA does. However, for many people that is reversed. Now that I'm graduated the Education SHOULD be after because nobody cares about it anymore. I've also had plenty of annecdotal experiece that indicates that having education first is what recruiters "expect".

I have one other annecdote that I think is something worth considering. Many students have volunteer experience. If the work that you were doing was volunteer experience, by all means, include a section for that (probably after Skills and before Honors). There are a large number of companies that have a soft requirement of having volunteer experience. However, I once had a recruiter (not engineer) for a large company look over my resume (which explains my work for 2 different non-profits) ask about any volunteer experience, and I had to explain that I'd put the experience of _Starting a Non-Profit_ as Experience. The recruiter then told me that I *NEEDED* to have a section for it. And that's when I decided that I *NEEDED* to look elsewhere for a job because I'd never work for them. 

Some of the, what I now consider to be less-savory, companies want to see it as a section. Just be aware of that volunteer experience is a factor in several companies' decisions, especially for young engineers. It shows that you go out of your way to help out which is an attribute that they look for.

### How Will You Present It?

How you fill all of the above in is up to you, but how you talk about it is really what's going to sell you. Whether you're at career fair or in an interview, the questions that are asked (assuming it is a non-technical interview) are going to be about the work that you did at each of the companies or orgs that you worked with.

You need to be ready for these questions. At the minimum you should have a 30 second to 1 minute description of each item on your resume. Example below:

Recruiter: So John, tell me a little bit about what you do at BakerRisk as a Process Safety Consultant
Me: I work in the process safety department and we primarily do facility siting and quantitative risk work. So we're modeling the potential consequences of releases at a facility, and then we're assigning a frequency to every one of those consequences, and in the end we're left with a risk. While I enjoy this work, I particularly enjoy (something related to the opening that I'm applying for).

But you should also expect to see some more specific questions like, what you did or didn't enjoy, etc.

Now you cannot just expect to follow a script and have that come off as natural. Everything on your resume should be something that you can naturally talk about, so talk about it naturally. Have a peer help you out and act as an "interviewer" and have them ask some questions.

## The Employer Perspective

I don't think that this is specific to engineers, but think epathetically when you're writing your resume. All of these notes refer back to how a recruiter is going to read a resume. So what are they looking for.

### What do They See?

- Unique experience. Are you a ChemE that used to be an operator? Do you know how to work on equipment? Do you know any special software?
- Previous analytic experience. Anything that can show that you've had to *really* think is a plus. Problem solving ++
- Proof that someone wanted you back. You're a lower risk candidate if you have experience that shows that you've worked for a company multiple times.
- Organization. If your resume is a mess, they will think you're a mess and trash it.
- Your reactions and explainations. While most companies that are worth working for will have engineers at the career fair and in interviews, they are still reading you as a person, and how you answer questions about your resume. 

## Summary

Put time into the resume and career fair preparation process. It will pay dividends. Work with your friends, as awkward as it might be at first, to actually practice talking about your resume. Not only does it help you when you're on the recieving end of the questions, but also pay attention to what questions you feel you want to ask when you're the "recruiter". Really put yourselves in the recruiters' shoes. Figure out what you did and didn't like about your friends' presentations of their resumes. Tell them what they could do better.

DO NOT script this out. If you script out responses you're SURE to fail. Nothing comes off as more socially awkward than canned responses.
