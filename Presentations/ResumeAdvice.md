# Changing Your Perspective on Your Engineering Resume

There are tons of sites that have resume tips and tricks, and you can (and should) get advice from the ECC as they are your best bet for being able to talk through your resume. However, as I've mentioned before, while the lofty goal of the ECC is to create good resumes, in reality it's much more pragmatic to create way more not-bad resumes.

Here we'll go over:

- Content
  - What experience to include
  - How to describe your experience
- Presentation
  - What your resume should look like
  - How will you talk about the topics on it
- The Employer Perspective
  - What do they see when they look at your resume
  
We're going to make this an exercise in taking an analytical look at yourself and your resume!

## Content

This is where you are communicating your (professional) life's story to a recruiter. You want to demonstrate to them what skills you've had, and if possible you want to show them that you've already created value in the positions you've held before.

### Experience to include - Struggles of Youth

You are engineering students before anything else in this job search. That means that engineering (more broadly "analytic") content MUST be the focus of your resume. Before you land your first analytical role it's hard to figure out what you should be including. Generally, the answer is to fill it up with project work, but only to the extent that it doesn't interfere with "real" experience

TA-ing, especially for this class, is "real" experience you can put on your resume.

### Experience to include - As a Resume Grows

As your resume gets longer and longer you will need to start pruning out experiences that you've had. Remember that you're writing a resume that is going to be consumed in about 30 seconds (if you're lucky) you're not writing a CV. But then the quesiton is, "what do I cut".

Unfortunately the answer is really to the question of what NOT to cut.

- Don't cut unique experience that you can't show elsewhere on your resume.
  - If you have experience that shows that you can work with people, and the rest of your work is, for example, basically just CAD work, consider leaving in that work.
- Dont' cut "real" experience that fills a time-gap in your resume (cut working at a froyo shop, don't cut working at a math camp)

Finally, most of you won't have enough experience by the time your graduate that you have to elimintate "real" experiences alltogether. Much of it will be pruning bullet points and sentences off of lesser experiences.

### How to Describe Your Experience

New and "experienced" resume writers alike forget that a recruiter is going to spend 10-30 seconds scanning your resume. They're looking for key indicators that you're a good candidate.
