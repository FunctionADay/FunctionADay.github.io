# How to know, and find, if a company is right for you

## Summary

We'll be discussing quite a bit here. The goal is the present an at least reasonably unbiased approach to figuring out what kind of job, career, and company are right for you. Here's an overview:

- Why You Should Care
- Company Characteristics
- School vs Job
- Figuring out what a company is about


## Why You Should Care

Most of you have a GPA that's high enough that you can work at nearly any company that's recruiting here, so I'm going to go through the rest of the presentation under the assumption that you are able to pick any single job you want. Of course you have to understand that isn't always realistic.

The main reason you should read through this is to avoid being miserable at your job. Personally I'm of the belief that I don't want to be working doing the things that I love because then I'll grow to hate them, and my annecdotal experience supports that. However on the flipside you don't want to be doing something that you hate. Your ideal day should be waking up, getting up, going to work, maybe it's tough, maybe you had a good converstation with your cubicle-mate, and then you go home, make dinner, and sit back and do something you like.

Before we move on keep in mind that the two primary movers for being able to get a job are: doing good work as an intern and fitting in at the office. 

## Company Characteristics

Companies, much like your 1331 students, come in types. No two are the same, but we can draw some common threads. Here I'll go through the different chracteristics and what types of people and characteristics fit those types of companies. Take this with the BIG caveat that this is based on one person's personal experience, so I suggest that you seek out someone in your field that you trust. Keep in mind, as I do here, that one person's experience is NOT a complete dataset (having 1 happy friend at a company doesn't mean that the 80% people that work there and hate themselves are wrong).

### Type of Work

Consulting - This is where I fit!! Most of my professional experience (less 2 summers at a lab, and one at a summer camp) have been in the consulting world. People in this space often have to be the expert in many different things at once. Ex. I do FSS/QRA work, I also do internal research projects, I know more MATLAB than anyone else in the company, I've got an unusual knowledge of pump curves. You will also (eventually) be managing clients which is a whole other game. You'll need a good bit of people skills here as you'll have to communicate with others.

R&D - The big thing here is the ability to adapt to the type of work you're doing. Depending on the company you might be doing one thing for your entire career (plenty of people do), or you might be designing a new part for you company's products on a monthly basis. You have to know what kind of schedule you'll be on here.

Plant Operation - Plants are where the money is made, what do you think is paying the consultants! Big paychecks come with big responsibilities. You can expect to be responsible for large projects and there is a certain amount of stress that you get in a plant that you don't get elsewhere. There are also safety concerns. Because many plant operators are 'big names' expect to need a high GPA and the ability to pass a technical interview (Styrolution!!)

Field Engineering - 100 Hour weeks seem fun right? What you don't like middle-of-nowhere Kansas? Well how do you feel about 120k/year?

### Company Size

Small - Again this is where I fit. Small companies can be hit or miss sometimes. Obviously the smaller the company (especially when small is accompanied by 'young') the bigger the chance that a bad year might mean you don't have a job. On the flip side you will be able to feel your impact at a small company. Did you develop a piece of software that automates a large chuck of work that allows you to push more clients, it's not just going to be your team of 5-10 that knows, everyone is going to see that.

Big - Big companies aren't always immune to the boom and bust (most of this effect has to do with the industry rather than the size of company), just take a look at Halliburton or Schlumberger. The most common thing that big companies have is structure. Find out if there is a clear corporate ladder at the company you want to work at. Is that ladder something that you think you can climb? Are you going to get forced into a role that you don't like? 

### Industry 

O&G - It gets more and more boom and bust as you move upstream (towards the people that get the oil out of the ground). 

Power - Everyone needs electricity. But is everyone always going to need nat-gas-based electricity? 

Chemicals - There is no end in sight for plastics. Chemicals is a safe industry as long as the company is good. Might not always be the biggest paycheck.

Manufacturing - So broad that it's hard to say, but consider where the product you make will be in 10 years. Are you skills going to transfer?

### Corporate Culture

What kind of environment do you like to be in? There are places where it is seen as unprofessional to swear, however these places are in the minority. Most businesses, even engineering ones, are filled with *normal people* that do normal people things. 

Formal tends to be office jobs, informal tends to be plant work. (if you showed up to a plant in a suit the operators would laugh at you)

### Work Schedule

Here I'll mainly focus on definitions. Just be aware that things like 9/80s, 4/40s, shift work 

9/80s - in 9 business days you work for 80 hours, the 10th day you have free. 
4/40s - similar but you generally have every Friday off and work 10 hour days (10 hour days start to feel LONG, especially if you take lunch off soooooo)
shift work - longer 12-hr shifts on fewer days in the week, often at weird hours
2-Weeks on 1 off - Sever similar schedules where you work many long hours for days or weeks at a time then you have a much longer extended period of time off. common for field engineers.

### Growth opportunities

This may prove to not be as important to our generation. Previously most people stayed within 2-3 maaaaaybe 4 companies in their career. Now there are people who are hitting their 4th company by the time they turn 30. The cynical will tell you that this is because there isn't a single company on earth that wants the best for you, they always want to pay you less and give fewer benefits. 

Buuuuut that's not really true of all companies. As long as you enjoy your work and are recieving pay appropriate to your qualifications you're in a good spot. More than anything an early job move might be to switch to work that suites you better.

Make sure you recognize the types of growth opportunities that are available in your company. Stalk your manager and their managers, what did their career paths look like?


## Just Like School

Remember all that anxiety over whether you're picking the right university (if not I envy you)? It's back!!! But now you're more prepared and know more about yourself and what you do and don't like. School is a great opportunity to compare to because you're in ti and experiencing it. With where you are now, consider the following. What would you choose for a university, and what would you choose for your career?

- Big Name 
- Financial Stability
- Relocation
- Future Prospects

Do you want to go out clubbin with your coworkers? There are places like that! (don't worry most places aren't)

## Figuring Out a Company

This is great, you've done some great introspection and you now know what kind of company that you want to work for! If only it were that easy. Now you have to find companies that actually match that description!

I'll present ways to search in order from least-useful to most-useful

### Glassdoor

Glassdoor is great because it lets you see slaries, how people generally feel about the company, and what common interview questions that you can look forward to!! It's great for prepping for interviews. That being said smaller companies might have limited responses, and they may be skewed by non-engineering staff.

### Former Employees

Former Employees are great because they can temper or reinforce what you found on glassdoor. If you can find someone that has worked or is working at the company that you're looking at then you should reach out to them and ask them about their experiences again with the HUGE Caveat that they aren't always predisposed to being honest!

### Interview

You can ask all the questions you've built up in the first two steps! The best way to get a vibe is to sit through interviews with the people that will probably end up being your managers. You'll be able to get a sense quickly whether a company is a good fit for you or not. Also keep in mind that the company will either be putting their best foot forward (really trying to get you to work for them) or playing hard to get (ex. very hard technical interview). Both of these are OK. Just make sure to weigh all the information you have from all 3 sources.

## Why This Matters

Saves your time in the job hunt and at career fair. 

If you do all this you're also going to have a better connection with the company when you go to interview.
